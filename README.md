# 🧠 COVID-19 Chest X-ray Classification using Deep Learning

This project presents a deep learning model based on a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** that classifies chest X-ray images into three medical categories:

* ✅ Normal
* 🦠 COVID-19
* 🫁 Viral Pneumonia

The model is built using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**, and is designed to assist in the early detection of COVID-19 and similar conditions through automated image classification.

## 🧠 What is this project?

This project is an **artificial intelligence model** (based on deep learning) that classifies **chest X-ray images** into three medical conditions:

* ✅ **Normal**
* 🦠 **COVID-19**
* 🫁 **Viral Pneumonia**

The model is built using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** and implemented with **TensorFlow and Keras** libraries.

## 🎯 What does the project do?

* Loads chest X-ray images in `.png` or `.jpg` format
* Preprocesses and resizes the images to fit the model input size `(224x224)`
* Predicts the medical class of the image: **Normal**, **COVID-19**, or **Viral Pneumonia**
* Displays the image with the predicted label 

---

## 🌟 Project Features

* ✅ **Easy to use**: Just provide a chest X-ray image and get the prediction
* 🎯 **High accuracy**: \~99.6% training and \~94.6% validation accuracy
* 📊 **Visual output**: Matplotlib is used to display the input image with predicted results
* 🎓 Ideal for **students, researchers, and beginners** in medical AI and deep learning
